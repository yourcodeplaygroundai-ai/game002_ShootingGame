# Community-Driven Game Experiment

This project began as an experiment in AI-assisted development, using Grok to generate the initial game code. We believe this is just the starting point.

**The goal is to see how much we can improve it together.** Whether you're refining the AI-generated prompts, rewriting core mechanics, or adding new features, all contributions are welcome. Let's make this game more fun and engaging through collaboration.
